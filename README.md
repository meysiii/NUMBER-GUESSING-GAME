# 🔹 Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive Python project where the computer randomly selects a number within a given range, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides hints like “Too High” or “Too Low”, guiding the player until the correct number is guessed.

This project introduces beginners to important Python concepts such as random number generation, loops, conditionals, and user input. It is lightweight yet highly engaging and can be enhanced into more advanced versions.

# 🔹 Features

🎯 Random number generation within a given range.

🖊️ User guesses until the correct number is found.

⬆️⬇️ Hints provided: "Too High" / "Too Low".

🔁 Loop continues until the player wins.

🎉 Congratulatory message on correct guess.

# 🔹 Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: random (for number generation)

Concepts Covered:

Loops (while, for)

Conditionals (if-elif-else)

Randomization

User input & validation

# 🔹 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game.git


# Navigate to the project folder:

cd number-guessing-game


# Run the Python file:

python number_guessing.py

# 🔹 Sample Output
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have selected a number between 1 and 50.
Can you guess it?

Enter your guess: 25
Too Low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 40
Too High! Try again.

Enter your guess: 33
Congratulations! 🎉 You guessed the number in 3 attempts!

# 🔹 Use Cases

Great practice for loops and conditional statements.

Helps beginners understand random number generation.

Can be used as a mini-game project for Python learners.
